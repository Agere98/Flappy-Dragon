## Notes
This demo was created using Unity ML-Agents Beta 0.8.1. If you are using a newer version of the toolkit, you may want to replace the `/Assets/ML-Agents` directory with the one you find in the toolkit's repository, and follow the [guide on migrating from earlier versions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Migrating.md).
